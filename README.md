# datastorr

Simple data versioning using GitHub to store data.

This package is designed to be used by other package authors, not directly by downstream end users.

## End user interface

See [here](https://github.com/richfitz/datastorr.example) for the aim from the point of view for an end user.

They would install your package (which contains no data so is nice and
light and can be uploaded to CRAN).

```r
devtools::install_github("richfitz/datastorr.example")
```

The user can see what versions they have locally

```r
datastorr.example::mydata_versions()
```

and can see what versions are present on github:

```r
datastorr.example::mydata_versions(local=FALSE) # remote
```

To download the most recent dataset:

```r
d <- datastorr.example::mydata()
```

Subsequent calls (even across R sessions) are cached so that the mydata() function is fast enough you can use it in place of the data.

To get a particular version:

```r
d <- datastorr.example::mydata("0.0.1")
```

Downloads are cached across sessions using `rappdirs`.
